## Features
### Offline
QuickCount can work entirely offline. In fact, it has no functionality that requires an internet connection, so it'll work wherever you need it.

### Dark Mode
QuickCount works with both Dark and Light mode in MacOS Mojave, so it will fit right into your workflow.

### Truly Free
QuickCount is entirely free. There are no ads, microtransactions, or even data tracking to worry about.

### Quick
As you would imagine, QuickCount is extremely fast at what it does. It's not unreasonable to copy a bit of text, open QuickType, and get its length in under one second, so long as you know keyboard shortcuts.

### Clean
QuickCount has no unnecessary features to slow down loading times, and clutter your view. It only has the bare essentials, which means you can work as quickly as possible.
